# PROGRAMMING LARRY: THE GUIDE

Let's say hypothetically you've been locked in a room and told to program Larry with nothing but VSCode, Python, a computer, a charger (you'll be in there for a while), some food (you'll be in there for a while), some water (you'll be in there for a while), a television (gotta keep up with the news), and, of course, Larry. As I write this guide, I am not locked in a room, and I do not have food, drink, or Larry, because it's 2:30 in the morning because I've been staying up late programming. However, I do have all the other stuff, so let's program Larry, I guess.

## PROGRAMMING LARRY: THE GUIDE: THE MOVIE

Now, let's say hypothetically you've been asked to create a movie about this guide. I'd be flattered.

Larry has 4 swerve modules, each module with 2 Falcon 500 motors. To refer to these motors in code, you'll want to refer to the motor controller that controls them, i.e. the TalonFX. One motor drives the wheel (like a tank drive motor) and the other rotates the wheel. Now, how do we make swerve drive with these motors? Try and figure it out yourself.

If you couldn't figure it out, don't worry, I don't know how to either!
