# TANK DRIVE

Welcome back! Or not. I don't know, I mean I don't wanna assume anything, you know.

Whatever, moving on, let's program Palpatine! Palpatine is a robot we have for practicing code on. It's a differential drive robot, which means two sides are controlled independent of each other. Basically, there's a left side, and a right side, and we pass different values to each side. Wow, you just learned a thing! Or didn't, if you already knew that. If you did, gold star for you! If you didn't, well, better luck next time.

This guide for programming tank drive will go very slowly, so feel free to skip through it if you feel you already have a good grasp on this.

Before we program this robot, let's go over tank drive.

## TANK DRIVE

Tank drive is an incredibly simple way to code a differential drive robot. All you do is take how far forward or backward the joysticks of your controller are, and then pass those to the motor, sort of like, you guessed it, a tank. Gold star for you! With a left and right joystick, you just have to pass the left joystick value to the left motors, and the right joystick value to the right motors.

## NOW THAT WAS SIMPLE!

It was, disembodied header! Boy, I sure do hope programming it is just as simple!

## SHUT UP

Wow, that's not very nice of you, dis-

## LEAVE ME ALONE

Is there something bothering you, disembodied header?

## YOU ARE BOTHERING ME

OK, dang, alright. Fair enough. Wow.

## PLEASE JUST GO BACK TO YOUR WEIRD PROGRAMMING GUIDE

Okie-dokie, disembodied headerokie!

Later in this guide, we'll go over frameworks you can use when programming a robot, but for now, let's just do things simple. Create a Python file, and name it whatever you want. It's usually best to name it ```robot.py```, though, so just do that unless you feel like being a rebel.

## THIS GUIDE SUCKS >:(

Gonna ignore that.
